\cf2 As of my last update in January 2022, Theater Mode in the Call of Duty: Black Ops series is a feature that allows players to review, save, and edit gameplay footage. The mode captures your in-game movements and actions so you can replay them later, offering a variety of camera angles and playback speeds. This is especially useful for players who want to analyze their gameplay, create highlight reels, or produce other kinds of video content.\
Theater Mode has been a popular feature among content creators for precisely the reasons you mentioned: it eliminates the need to constantly record while playing, thus saving system resources. Additionally, it allows you to review gameplay more critically, which can be a great aid in improving your skills.\
However, Theater Mode still requires manual review and editing to create a final highlight reel or other video content, and this is where your idea of an automated highlight-creating tool could come into play. Combining the detailed replay functionality of Theater Mode with automated editing software could save a lot of time and make the content creation process much more streamlined.\

\cf2 I wanted to implement something similar to theater mode's tagging of enemy downs, kills, assists, etc for gameplay videos I have in Call of Duty Warzone.

\ls1\ilvl0\cf2 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 		\expnd0\expndtw0\kerning0
Video Input: You need to be able to import or load the raw gameplay footage into your application.\
\ls1\ilvl0\kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 		\expnd0\expndtw0\kerning0
Event Tagging Criteria: Define what events to tag\'97enemy downs, kills, assists, etc. Establish the criteria that the software should use to identify these in the video.\
\ls1\ilvl0\kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 		\expnd0\expndtw0\kerning0
Video Analysis: This is the core of your application. It would involve scanning the video frame-by-frame to identify the events you want to tag.\

\ls1\ilvl1\kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 {\listtext	\uc0\u8226 	}\expnd0\expndtw0\kerning0
Advanced method: Use machine learning to train a model that can recognize these events based on visual and audio cues.\
\pard\tx220\tx720\pardeftab720\li720\fi-720\partightenfactor0
\ls1\ilvl0\cf2 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 		\expnd0\expndtw0\kerning0
Tagging and Metadata: When an event is identified, tag it and create metadata to describe what happened. This could include time-stamps, type of event, and other relevant information.\
\ls1\ilvl0\kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 		\expnd0\expndtw0\kerning0
User Interface: Develop an interface where the user can see these tagged events, possibly navigate to them, and decide which to include in a highlight reel.\
\ls1\ilvl0\kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 		\expnd0\expndtw0\kerning0
Video Clipping and Export: The user can then export these moments individually or as a compiled highlight reel.\

\ls2\ilvl0\cf2 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 		\expnd0\expndtw0\kerning0
Python: Libraries like OpenCV for video processing and possibly TensorFlow for machine learning could be very useful.\
\ls2\ilvl0\kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 		\expnd0\expndtw0\kerning0
Frontend: For the user interface, you could use standard web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, or a Python GUI library if you prefer a standalone application.\

\ls3\ilvl0\cf2 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 		\expnd0\expndtw0\kerning0
Preprocessing: Import the video and prepare it for analysis.\
\ls3\ilvl0\kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 		\expnd0\expndtw0\kerning0
Event Detection: Scan through the video to identify and tag the events based on your criteria.\

Computational Intensity: Video analysis, especially if using machine learning, can be computationally intense.\
\ls4\ilvl0\kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 		\expnd0\expndtw0\kerning0
Accuracy: Depending on your approach, there might be false positives or negatives.\
\ls4\ilvl0\kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 		\expnd0\expndtw0\kerning0
User Experience: The user interface should be intuitive and responsive, offering a good user experience.\

Market Research\cf0 \cb4 \
Tasks:\
1. Identify Competitors: Was not able to identify anything similar to this idea\
2. Identify Gaps: This will speed up editing process for video game content creators\
3. Community Interaction: Going to hold off on this for now until I have a framework of the application\
\
Tool Requirements\
Core Features:\
 1. Auto select highlight plays from call of duty videos\
 	- Filter highlights based on:\
		- Kills:  When we kill an enemy player\
		- Downs: when we down an enemy player\
		- Shield Breaks: when we break an enemies shields\
		- Near Death Moments: when your screen is flashing red\
		- Intense Moments:  Quick movement escapes, kills, with a lot of action going on\
		- Player Downs: when you are downed as a player\
		- Player Shield Break: when player\'92s shields are broken\
		- Revives: when you revive an enemy player\
		- Teammate Deaths: when your teammate is killed\
		- Teammate Downs: when your teammate is downed\
		- Team wipe: when you wipe a team\
		- Laugh moments: detect audio when you are laughing\
 2. Clip and export selected moments or combine to a single video.\
\
Nice to Have Features:\
 1. Train program on custom criteria based on user input.\
 2. Full video editing option to create, stylize, scene transitions, import music for custom highlight videos\
 3. Fully automated highlight video creation with 1 click. Click 1 button and it will automatically extract the best parts of the video, edit them together, stylize and create a highlight video that can be exported. \
 4. Be able to track events from kill feed indicator on the screen. For instance, if your teammate gets a kill and shows in the kill feed, the program will detect the text and log the name of the player and the event.\
\
Initial Game Support:\
 1. Would like to start specifically with Call of Duty Warzone as a proof of concept, then expand into other games.\
\
Milestone Planning\
Tasks:\
1. Create a Timeline: Completed\
2. Task Breakdown: Created Trello Board \
3. Assign Deadlines: These will need to be flexible as my work schedule will increase drastically in the coming months.\
\
\
### Next Steps\
1. **Technical Feasibility**:  I have extremely limited programming knowledge but am familiar with python. I have already set up my libraries based on your previous recommendation. I can provide code you have given so far. \
2. **Resource Requirements**: I plan on working on this project alone\
3. **Data Collection**: I would like to eventually incorporate machine learning with vision in the future. Currently we are extracting audio and video templates as a source material. Then scanning another video and saving a clip of the kill. You had me set up my virtual environment and this folder setup:\
\
src Folder\
-> audio_templates\
-> video_templates\
-> gameplay_video\
collect_templates.py\
find_highlights.py\
main.py\
\
Let me know if you need more information. I can also supply the code that is currently in the .py files\
\
find_highlights.py\
-Multithreaded\
\
\
\
\
Machine Learning\
\
Define the Problem and Establish Goals\
 -Expected outcomes\
	-Find and identify events within the game loaded gameplay video. Events will include:\
		- Kills:  When we kill an enemy player\
		- Downs: when we down an enemy player\
		- Shield Breaks: when we break an enemies shields\
		- Near Death Moments: when your screen is flashing red\
		- Intense Moments:  Quick movement escapes, kills, with a lot of action going on\
		- Player Downs: when you are downed as a player\
		- Player Shield Break: when player\'92s shields are broken\
		- Revives: when you revive an enemy player\
		- Teammate Deaths: when your teammate is killed\
		- Teammate Downs: when your teammate is downed\
		- Team wipe: when you wipe a team\
		- Laugh moments: detect audio when you are laughing\
	- Success will be based on if it can select, clip, and export each of these highlight videos. Success will also involve not having any duplicate clips. Success will be dictated by how exciting each segment is and the clip is an appropriate length\
	-Would like to begin focus on shield breaks, downs, and kills as these are typically sequential events\
\cf2 \cb3 \
Data Collection\
	-Already have assortment of video and audio templates \
	\cb5 -Extract frames and sound bites from the templates\
	Store in most structured  format\
